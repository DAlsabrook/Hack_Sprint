# Hack Sprint

Welcome to our Hack Sprint project for Atlas School, a sequential discovery puzzle game where you play as a software developer battling against a rogue AI that has taken over your system. Your mission: to regain control by solving puzzles and deciphering clues hidden throughout the website.

## Game Overview

On our site, you will encounter a series of puzzles that require critical thinking, attention to detail, and a keen understanding of web technologies. The AI has begun posting fake articles autonomously, and it's up to you to stop it before its influence spreads. As you solve puzzles, you will piece together the username and password needed to disable the AI.

### Puzzles:

1. **HTML Inspection**: Your first task is to inspect the webpage's HTML content to find your initial clues.
2. **YouTube Error**: After attempting to log in with incomplete credentials, a YouTube video will play. Pausing the video triggers an error message in the browser console, providing the next part of the credentials.
3. **Logo Discovery**: The final clue is cleverly hidden behind the site logo in the footer. Hovering over the logo will cause it to pivot and "fall," revealing the full password.

## Game End

Upon successfully logging in and disabling the AI, you will be redirected to a detailed essay discussing the dangers of AI-generated content. This essay highlights how AI's capability to generate convincing articles can influence public opinion and stresses the importance of awareness and skepticism among readers.
